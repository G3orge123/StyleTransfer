# StyleTransfer

This project implements Neural Style Transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Overview
The goal of this project is to blend the content of one image with the style of another image, using deep learning models built in Python with TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Features
- Content and Style extraction from input images
- Style transfer optimization
- Visualization of intermediate results

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Open `StyleTransferIAVA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to perform style transfer.
